                The objective of Targeted Intervention Programme is to reduce the rate of transmission among the most vulnerable and marginalized population.
                One of the ways of controlling the disease from further spread is to carry out direct intervention programmes among these groups through multi-pronged strategies,
                beginning from behavior change communication, counseling, providing healthcare support, treatment for STD, and creating an enabling environment that will facilitate behavior change.
                Targeted Intervention is one of the most important components of the National AIDS Control Programme â€“ Phase II.

                Maharashtra has a long history of involvement of NGOs in development programs,
                and they have played a vital role in the overall development of the state.
                Till today, NGOs have played an important role in reaching high-risk groups and have the capacity and commitment to work in the field of HIV/AIDS.
            </p>
            <ul style={{ fontSize: '17px'}}>
                <li>NGOs are directly involved with the people of their communities.
                    They have knowledge about the community needs and have support from the community.</li>
                <li>The NGOs can give voice to people's priorities.
                    Through this, the NGOs can become a bridge between the Government and the Community.</li>
                <li>The NGOs can respond quickly, directly, and sensitively to the needs of the people.</li>
                <li>They are flexible and able to incorporate community feedback immediately into action.
                    The NGOs can offer a range of innovative specialized services for the people affected by the AIDS epidemic and their programs are cost-effective.
                    With proper technical and financial support from the Government, NGOs will help the government achieve its goals.</li>
